               ensuring a successful renovation. In this article, we’ll provide

                     <strong>Know your budget:</strong> Before you start any
                     renovation, it’s important to know your budget. This will
                     help you make decisions about the scope of your project and
                     the materials and finishes you can afford. Be sure to
                     factor at least 10% in unexpected costs, such as permits,
                     labor, and unforeseen structural issues. If you don’t know
                     your budget, call Sarasota Remodeling and Design and get a

                     Renovations can disrupt your daily routine and create chaos
                     in your home. Be prepared for the inconvenience and make
                     arrangements for alternative living arrangements, if
                     necessary. Consider the safety of your family and pets
                     during the renovation process. At Sarasota Remodeling and

                     important to keep the big picture top of mind. Make sure
