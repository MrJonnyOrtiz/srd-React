               What’s Aging-in-place Remodeling?
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
               As people age, they may face challenges with mobility, balance,
               accessibility, and safety in their homes. Aging-in-place
               remodeling refers to the modifications made to a home to make it
               more accommodating and accessible for seniors. These
               modifications can help seniors live independently and comfortably
               in their own homes for as long as possible. We’re excited to
               share some remodeling ideas that can help seniors live safely and
               comfortably in their own home as part of our aging-in-place
               remodeling services.

                     <strong>Install grab bars and handrails</strong>
                     Installing grab bars and handrails in strategic locations
                     can greatly improve seniors' safety and mobility. Grab bars
                     can be installed in the bathroom near the toilet and
                     shower, and handrails can be installed on stairs and
                     hallways. These features provide support, balance, and
                     stability, making it easier for seniors to navigate their
                     homes.

                     <strong>Improve lighting</strong> Poor lighting can be
                     hazardous for seniors, especially those with poor eyesight.
                     Installing brighter and more energy-efficient lighting
                     fixtures can improve visibility and reduce the risk of
                     falls. With a little tech, we can install motion-activated
                     lights in hallways, bathrooms, and other high-traffic
                     areas.

                     <strong>Consider a walk-in bathtub or shower</strong>
                     A walk-in bathtub or shower can make bathing safer and more
                     comfortable for seniors. These features eliminate the need
                     to step over a high bathtub wall or climb into a shower
                     stall, reducing the risk of falls. Additionally, adding a
                     bench or seat inside the shower can provide a comfortable
                     place to sit while showering.

                     <strong>Replace doorknobs with lever handles</strong>
                     Doorknobs can be difficult to operate for seniors with
                     arthritis or limited hand mobility. Replacing doorknobs
                     with lever handles can make opening and closing doors much
                     easier. Lever handles can be operated with a gentle push or
                     pull, requiring less effort and pressure than traditional
                     doorknobs.

                     <strong>Consider a stairlift or elevator</strong> Stairs
                     can pose a challenge for seniors with mobility issues.
                     Installing a stairlift or elevator can make it easier for
                     seniors to move between floors of their home. Stairlifts
                     are installed on the stairs and can carry the user up and
                     down, while elevators are free-standing and can travel
                     between floors.
